This simple machine learing project focuses on predicting weather using AdaBsoot classifier. This is after comparing 3 methods of orediction that is XGB classifier, K-Nearest neighbors classifier and Adaboost classifier.
The data contains contains 6 varibales that is:date, precipitation, temp_max, temp_min, wind and Weather.
